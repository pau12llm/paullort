# paullort

Hi! I'm Pau üë®‚Äçüíª, a third-year Computer Engineering student at La Salle, Ramon Llull University, Barcelona. My passion is solving complex problems with innovative technological solutions. From building distributed systems in C, to cloud projects using AWS, and developing web and mobile applications, I enjoy every technical challenge that comes my way.

I have worked on projects ranging from watch restoration with my personal business, VintageReeditions, including the development, management, and maintenance of its website, to implementing web applications like Battle Arena, a real-time RPG, using Vue.js and APIs. Additionally, I have delved into the world of IoT with Helium Networks, designing and optimizing long-range antennas through telematic calculations and strategic positioning.

Currently, my focus is on expanding my skills in software development, distributed systems, and emerging technologies. I love learning new things and applying that knowledge to real-world projects.
